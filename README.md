# Pinching Pennies Purpose
Pinching Pennies is a solution to tracking and managing finances in a quick, easy, portable way. After surveying friends and family members, it became
apparent that many prefer a homegrown Excel spreadsheet over a dedicated app because they were all missing something. Pinching Pennies is my aim at
filling the gap between what is currently offered through apps, and what people actually want / will use.

Pinching Pennies was designed and developed using the Agile SDLC methodology and implemented as a solo-project using something similar to a Scrumban 
framework. The project in its current form is meant as the first release in an ongoing development cycle of improvement. More features will follow.

This project is an Android App developed in Android Studio and written in Java. Data is stored on-device using SQLite which was implemented with the 
Room persistence library.

This project showcases skills learned throughout my education in Software Development, including: 
- Proficiency coding in Java
- Unit Testing
- RDBMS handling
- UI/UX Design
